# Path-Finding-Visualizers
Pathfinding algorithms are used to find the (usually) shortest path between two points or nodes.
This is an implementation to look into how those algorithms function, the efficiency and the efficacy of different pathfinding algorithms.

## Pathfinding Algorithms used:
### 1. A* (shortest path)
### 2. Dijkstra (shortest path)
